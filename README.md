Bugs
- While running `npm run start` and making edits to the code, sometimes I'd see a bug where the page refreshes and models render out of place or rotate in incorrect directions.
  Sometimes this also happens on the initial `npm run start`.  I'm not sure what the cause is, but reloading the page usually puts things back in order.
